# Fake News Detector using NLP

* This is my work from the first 3 weeks.
## 📅 Week 1
* I practiced using the NumPy and Pandas library provided in the additional_problems file and completed the following tasks for week1
 * File: `np_assignment_25b2110.ipynb`
* File:`pandas_2_25b2110.ipynb`
* File:`pandas_3_25b2110.ipynb`
* File:`pandas_4_25b2110.ipynb`
## 📅 Week 2
* I completed the crash course for Machine-Learning and understood the behaviour of a model.
* In intro to NLP, learned to cleanup the text,concept of vectorisation,model training and evaluatiom.
 ## 📅 Week 3
* I started the Fake News Detector.
* I learned the Grammer of Scikit-Learn.
* I learned how to scrub text to remove links and punctuation with Regex and TF-IDF to convert words into numbers.
* I used a Logistic Regression model to try and guess if news is fake.
* File: `samplenotebook (1).ipynb`
 ## 📅 Week 4
* I changed my model from Logistic Regression to Passive Aggressive Classifier and trained it till I got accuracy more than 93%.
* I saved the trained model using joblib so that I don’t have to train the model again and again.
* Then I tested the model by giving some real and fake news headlines which confused the model and then I wrote why the model failed there.
* After that, I made a simple web app using Gradio where user can enter a news text and get result as real or fake.
* Finally, I deployed the model by launching the app with a public link.
